</p> This BA folder includes all material used for the development and evaluation of the extractor. 
</p> The excel <i>ExtractorValidation</i> includes a list of all implemented constructs and the results of the recall and precision testing. The list of all implemented constructs is also uploaded separately as <i>ImplementedConstructs</i>.
</p> The zip <i>Input_Texts.zip</i> contains the texts on which the precision testing was conduced.
</p> The zip <i>Output_Xmis.zip</i>  contains the output of the precision testing and allows to track all annotations/tags
</p> The document <i>WrongTags</i> is a documentation of all identified wrong annotations produced by the other Taggers (NOT EGPConstruct). Wrong EGPConstruct-Annotations can be found in the ExtractorValidation excel marked as red, if based on an inherent Construct-Rule bug, and marked as orange, if based on one of the wrong tags collected in DocumentationWrongTags
